Retrospective
What did we do well?
Fully scheduled Sprint was great
Moving in the right direction with tickets and backlog
Communication within the team is good
Good feedback on what we're doing, this help reinforce that we're working on real products that are important
We can be very quick with the project we fully understand. The more Monster work, the better!
We can be even faster if we have fully prepared mock-up. Guessing how to build an app is hard and makes it slower for us.
What should we have done better?
Estimate of the tickets were really not accurate (we decided to change a little bit how we estimate, increase # of points for things that are unclear, and reduce points for Monster-UI stories about adding features etc...)
Still unsure on how to fit the back-end engineer into the team
Be on time for stand-ups
Try to add more details to the tickets, and understanding the interdependencies so we can estimate them better
Make sure to remove all the things we can't do from a ticket, and create a new one with these things, whether it's for back-end, OPS, design, etc... (and referencing each other so we don't lose track of them)
We need to get more wireframes/mock-ups for the things we work on
