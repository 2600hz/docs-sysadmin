When a customer complains an inbound number isn't working:
Call the number yourself, see if it rings from a system phone
Call the number from your cell phone or an out side line. See if it rings.
If it works outside but not inside...
XXX DARREN FILL IN
 
If it works inside but not outside...
HELP ME RONDA! HELP HELP ME RONDA!
 
It the above both work:
ZZZZ
