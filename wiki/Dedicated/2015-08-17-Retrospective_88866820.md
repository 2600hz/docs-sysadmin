Retrospective
What did we do well?
Super happy with design work from Josh
Peter is awesome
We are more than happy to take on UI work that is in parallel with the backend, so long as we have Peter available to us
What should we have done better
Hard to effectively split tickets into engineering steps to more easily point them, but we should try to implement this going forward
Ticket scheduling was okay- could have done more work, but it worked out okay because we had some things go not smoothly
Some tickets are remaining- they are remaining because we were waiting on Karl
This is information from Karl and work from Karl
