Retrospective
What did we do well
Mockups are good, well executed, likes the style
enjoying working on a new app (has been a year) (Joris)
What should we have done better?
would be a little better if we could get them (mock-ups) before pointing stuff
tickets filed during meetings aren't touched later and they aren't flushed out enough
vacation times screwed the sprint (screwed the estimates)
back-end fixes take some time to get on our environment (not much we can do about that)
