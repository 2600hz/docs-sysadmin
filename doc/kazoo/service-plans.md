## Service Plans



Service Plans define costs associated with various services in the system. Services figure out how many devices, trunks, users and similar 
features are in use for an account. Those totals are applied to one or more service plans on the account and then passed to a bookkeeper to handle the actual billing functionality.
 
## Use Case

New guy just installed his cluster, wants to bill his clients
 

## Configuring a Service Plan

A service plan document defines services, such as DIDs or SIP devices, which have a cost. It also defines the name of the corresponding element that will be used in your given bookkeeper (i.e. you may call DIDs in Quickbooks Phone Numbers, and therefore you need to map our name to your name). Together, these two concepts make up a service plan. The service plan document(s) is located within a reseller's account. The master account on every system is automatically considered the default reseller.


## Master / Default Service Plans

Standard accounts are accounts which live underneath a reseller. By default, the master account is the first reseller in the system. For the purposes of this example, we'll assume you're creating your first account beneath your master/reseller account.


**Find Your Master Account**

1. You'll need the account-ID if you don't already know it.

2. Go into the master account's database via **BigCouch**'s Futon interface

3. Create a new document

4. Add the field `pvt_type` with the value `service_plan`

5. Add a plan 

    object {phone_numbers: {     
    did_us: { name: US DID,rate: 1,    
    discounts: {
    cumulative: {                   
    maximum: 2,                  
    rate: 0.5
      }
    },
           
    cascade: false },
       
    tollfree_us: { name: US Tollfree
    ,rate: 5
    ,cascade: true           
    ,minimum: 10
       }
     },
     
    number_services: {       
    cnam: { name: CNAM Update
    ,activation_charge: 2
    },
       
    port: {           
    name: Port Request
    ,activation_charge: 5
    },
       
    e911: {
     name: E911 Service
    ,rate: 5     
    ,discounts: {single: {rate: 5 }
       }
       }
    }
   
   limits: { twoway_trunks: { name: Two-Way Trunk, rate: 29.99 }
     ,inbound_trunks: { name: Inbound Trunk,rate: 19.99 }
   
    },
    
   devices: { _all: {
    name: SIP Device
    ,as: sip_devices
    ,cascade: true,
           
   rates: {5: 0         
    ,20: 24.95        
    ,50: 49.95           
    ,100: 149.95
      }
     }
    }
   }

## Advanced Features

It may be useful to have a reseller account with subaccounts, who in turn have their own subaccounts, all billing back to the reseller account. An account's reseller is determined by looking at each parent until the first account with a reseller flag is found. If no such account is found, the master account is used.
