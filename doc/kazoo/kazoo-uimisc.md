## Kazoo UI

Contrary to popular belief, **Kazoo UI** doesn't need to be installed anywhere in particular. In fact, since **Kazoo UI** just accesses the native **Kazoo** APIs, you can install **Kazoo UI** right on your local computer with the only requirement being a local web browser.
This opens up interesting opportunities. You can develop **Kazoo UI** add-ons locally without touching your production servers which are running a different version of **Kazoo UI**, all using the same APIs. The **Kazoo** APIs can be on **Kazoo** Hosted or your own installation. This essentially allows you to heavily customize the user experience, whether or not you utilize a hosted API platform managed by you.
