## Kazoo Service Limits



**Kazoo** provides facilities to limit what services are being used by a particular client. Limits can involve simultaneous outbound channels, simultaneous inbound channels, total channel count, and enforcement of credit minimums. 

**These features can be used to provide:**

1. Two-way SIP Trunks
2. Inbound SIP Trunks
3. Per-Minute SIP Trunks
4. Per-Minute Hosted PBX Calling
5. General Resource Consumption Limits
6. Pre-Pay Cost Tracking
7. Post-Pay Cost Tracking
8. Basic Fraud Limitations (Prevent post-pay accounts from dipping 
 too deep into their credit)
 
**Talking Points:**

1. How to tell if a call was rated as a per-minute or a flat-rate.
2. How to tell if a call was billed properly or not (accounting table?).
3. How to double-check billing, if possible.
4. Tools to run to re-run billing, if possible, for a CDR.
