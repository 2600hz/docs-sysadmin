## Kazoo Rating Engine



## Build Your Own Rating Engine

Here are the steps to easily add your own rating engine to **Kazoo** (and bypass the **HotOrNot WhApp**).

How calls are rated in **Kazoo**

When a new call is received in the `ecallmgr` application, a rating request is published onto the AMQP bus. Any application bound for those rate request events will receive the JSON payload and can optionally respond with a rate response. The first valid response received will be the rate applied to the call.


## Rate Request JSON

**Kazoo** generates a rate request payload published onto the callmgr exchange with a routing key of rate.req. The JSON payload will look something along the lines of:

**Rate Request JSON:**

    {To-DID:+14158867900
    ,Call-ID:abc123def456ghi789
    ,Event-Category:rate
    ,Event-Name:req
    ,Msg-ID:msg_id_9876
    ,Server-ID:amqp_queue_name
    ,App-Name:sending_app
    ,App-Version:sending_app_ver
    ,Node:ecallmgr@host.com
    ,Account-ID:qwerty1234567890
    ,From-DID:+14158867915
    ,Options:[] 
    ,Direction:inbound

    }


**Description of the Rate Request JSON payload:**

```Field:Description
Value : Required
To-DID: The dialed number
The dialed number off the INVITE
Yes
Call-ID: The unique identifier for this channel
String: Yes
Event-Category: The class of event
Rate: Yes
Event-Name: The name of the event
Req: Yes
Msg-ID: The ID of this rate request message
String: Yes
Server-ID: The name of the AMQP queue of the sender, empty if no response is needed
String: Yes
App-Name: The name of the application that published the request
String: Yes
App-Version: The version of the application that published the request
String: Yes
Node: The **Erlang** VM node name of the sender
String: Yes
Options: Arbitrary list of strings set by sender, usually used by receiving to filter list of applicable rates
List of strings: No 
```

## Direction

The direction of the call, relative to Kazoo; 
outbound: meaning from **Kazoo** to the endpoint and 
inbound: meaning from the endpoint to **Kazoo**
inbound/ outbound:No

``
Account-ID: The **Kazoo** account ID associated with this cal (if any)
String: No
From-DID : The Caller ID number (if available)
String: No
```

## Route Response JSON

Any application which receives rate requests and wishes to respond will need to publish the response to the targeted exchange using the Server-ID from the rate request payload as the routing key. Assuming the request above, a potential response would be constructed thusly:

**Rate Response JSON:**

    {Rate:0.05
    ,Call-ID:abc123def456ghi78
    ,Rate-Increment:60
    ,Rate-Minimum:60
    ,Discount-Percentage:0
    ,Surcharge:1.00
    ,Rate-Name:expensive_rate
    ,Base-Cost:1.05
    ,Msg-ID:msg_id_9876
    ,Update-Callee-ID:true
    ,Event-Category:rate
    ,Event-Name:resp
    ,App-Name:hotornot
    ,App-Version:1.0.0
    ,Server-ID:
    ,Node:whistle_apps@host.com

    }

```

**Description of the Rate Response JSON payload:**


```Field:Description
Value: Required
Rate: The cost of the rate
Float: Yes
Call-ID: Identifier of the channel
String:Yes
Event-Category: Class of message
Rate:Yes
Event-Name: Name of the message type
Resp: Yes
App-Name: Name of the responding application
String: Yes
App-Version: Version of the responding application
String: Yes
Msg-ID: The ID from the request payload that identifies the request message
String: Yes
Node: The responder's node (useful mostly for debugging)
String: Yes
Server-ID: Empty, since no response to this message will be sent
Rate-Increment: How many seconds before Rate is applied
Integer (defaults to 60): No
Rate-Minimum: Minimum number of seconds to bill the call for, regardless of call duration
Integer, defaults to 60: No
Discount-Percentage: Apply a discount to the cost of the call
Integer: No
Surcharge: Flat amount to bill the call (in addition to per-minute charges)
Float: No
Rate-Name: Arbitrary name for the rate
String: No
Base-Cost: (Rate * (Rate-Minimum div 60)) + Rate-Surcharge
Float: No
Update-Caller-ID: If `true`, will prepend the Callee ID name with the rate of the call
Boolean, defaults to `false`: No
```

## Rate Field

The `rate` fields (Rate, Rate-Increment, etc) will be set on the channel and available in the 
Custom-Channel-Vars of the resulting CDR. A simple formula is used to calculate the cost of the call: 
 
 
R = Rate
RI = Rate-Increment
RM = Rate-Minimum
Sur = Surcharge
Secs = Billing Seconds
When RM  `60 = Sur + ((RM / 60) * R)`
When `RM = 60 = Sur + ((RM / 60) * R) + ceiling((Secs - RM) / RI) * ((RI / 60) * R)))`
