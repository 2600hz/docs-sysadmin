## HAPROXY



*Use haproxy 1.5 to create an SSL reverse proxy*

If you're working from an existing install, you will likely need to remove haproxy 1.4 before continuing.  Be sure to take a backup of `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`!

`yum erase haproxy`

We are going to build **HAProxy** from a source `rpm`, so we need to install a few things:

`yum install @development openssl-devel pcre-static pcre-devel`

Then we download a source `rpm` to build from:

`curl -O http://dagobah.ftphosting.net/yum/SRPMS/haproxy-1.5-dev14.src.rpm`

Then we build the `rpm`:

`rpmbuild --rebuild haproxy-1.5-dev14.src.rpm `

Then we install the `rpm` we just built:

`rpm -Uvh rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/haproxy-1.5-dev14.x86_64.rpm`

Let's move the original config back in place:

`mv /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.rpmsave /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`

Let's make a directory for the cert/s:

`mkdir -p /etc/haproxy/certs`

Put your `pem` cert/key into the `certs` folder:

`mv certificate.pem /etc/haproxy/certs`

Add the following to the `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg config`:

```
frontend whapps-ssl-in
    bind *:8443 ssl crt /etc/haproxy/certs/certificate.pem
    default_backend whapps
backend whapps
    balance roundrobin
    server localhost host.domain.com:8000 check
```

Restart **HAProxy** and enjoy!
 
 
## Cleanup:

Update the `/var/www/html/config/config.js` for the new `https`: and `port`

You may need to update the endpoint entries for existing users to point to the new `https`: and `port`, you can see how to do that here: 


## Manually Editing Database Documents

**Notes:**

If you have an existing cert, `ca-bundle` and `key`, here's how you can make the `pem`:

`cat certificate.crt ca-bundle.crt private.key > certificate.pem`

Hopefully it's obvious that the paths, and host names need to be updated for your environment.
