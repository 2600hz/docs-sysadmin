## Lineman Expect



The lineman expect tool is a way of defining an expected response from any of the other tools.  This is done by binding to events and specifying the expected value.

## Toolbag

This tool has no configuration parameters.


## Sequence Elements

All sequence elements are in a expect element and described by the type attribute, which defaults to line if not present. This section will be broken down by the available types (more will be added).  For the available bindings see the other tool pages. 

`expect[@type='line']`

Compares the expected content with the binding content line by line.  This comparison is implemented by searching for the existence of each line of the expected content in the entire binding content.  Failure to find any line or receive content in the defined timeout will fail the current sequence.

Attribute / Description / Type

The value can be line or not present binding. The binding that should carry the expected content timeout. The time in milliseconds to wait for a binding content, defaults to 1000.

`clean` if this is set to `false` then the XML value will not be cleaned up. See **Lineman Test Tool** for details.
